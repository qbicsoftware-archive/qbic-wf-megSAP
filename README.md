# QBIC-megSAP-NGS
Nextflow workflows for the analysis of samples using the megSAP pipeline.

### Introduction

The QBIC-megSAP-NGS pipeline is a medical genetics pipeline based on best-practices from imgag/megSAP and is primarily used for Exome analysis at our core-facility at [QBIC](https://qbic.life), Germany.

### Documentation

The pipeline itself is developed at the [Institute for Medical Genetics](https://github.com/imgag/megSAP) in Tuebingen, Germany. The accompanying scripts within this repository were however written for use at the [QBIC](https://qbic.life) and our local clusters CFC and [BinAC](http://www.zdv.uni-tuebingen.de/dienstleistungen/computing/hardware/binac.html).

### Notes

The content of the `megSAP/data` folder is not bundled with this container to keep the actual pipeline separated from the data. In case you want to use this container on your own infrastructure, please download the data / tools yourself, index things using the scripts provided with the pipeline and then manually mount the paths to the respective `data` folder inside this container yourself.  

### Credits

Credits for the actual pipeline implementation should go to [Marc Sturm](https://github.com/imgag/megSAP) and other contributors. See the respective repository for the development of the actual pipeline. The NextFlow pipeline and parts of this repository here have been implemented by Alex Peltzer ([@apeltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer)). Special thanks to Phil Ewels and Rickard Hammar√©n at SciLifeLab for providing templates, ideas and their own [pipeline](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-RNAseq) as a best-practice template for us when developing our own pipeline.
